# PyO3 Demonstration

A simple Python project that makes use of a Rust library, via [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

Requires [maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin).

## Known Issues

Complications around `cargo test`, described in `Cargo.toml`. May be a symptom of using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)?
